        <p><strong>Tenacious D</strong> is an American comedy rock duo, formed in Los Angeles, California in 1994. It was
          founded by actors Jack Black (JB) and Kyle Gass (KG), who were part of The Actor's Gang theater company at the
          time. The duo's name is derived from "tenacious defence" - a phrase used by NBA basketball sportcaster Marv Albert.</p>
        <p>Prior to the release of Tenacious D's 2001 debut album, the duo had a three-episode TV series released on HBO,
          with the episodes broadcasting between 1997 to 2000. These episodes came about after the band had met David Cross
          and Bob Odenkirk on the Los Angeles music scene - and Black featuring in episodes of Mr. Show with Bob and David.
          The band also befriended former Nirvana drummer Dave Grohl, and this would begin a working relationship between
          Foo Fighters and Tenacious D. Towards the end of the 1990s, the duo would go on to support large rock acts such
          as Pearl Jam, Tool and Beck.</p>
        <p>In 2000, they signed with Epic Records, and the year after released their debut album featuring a full band -
          including Grohl on the drums. The first single, "Tribute", has since achieved cult-status, and made the band popular
          overseas. In 2003, Tenacious D released their first concert DVD - The Complete Master Works, which went on to achieve
          gold and platinum status by the RIAA.</p>
        <p>In 2006, they starred in and recorded the soundtrack for, the film Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny. After the
          completion of The Pick of Destiny world tour in 2007, the band made sporadic appearances, mainly at the likes of
          benefit concerts and festivals.</p>
        <p>Tenacious D's music showcases Black's theatrical vocal delivery and Gass' acoustic guitar playing abilities. Critics
          have described their fusion of vulgar absurdist comedy with rock music as "mock rock."</p>
